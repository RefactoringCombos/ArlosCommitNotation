# |               |     |   1. reviewed original and new behaviour with customer          |
# |               |     |     representative                                              |

# |               |     |   3. the original (buggy) behavior was captured in a unit test  |

# |               |     |   4. change includes 1 changed unit test, matching intended     |
# |               |     |     behavior alteration.                                        |

# | Refactoring   | r - | Provable refactoring [link-1]                                   |
# |               | r - | Test-supported Procedural Refactoring within test code [link-2] |
# |               | R - | Test-supported Procedural Refactoring [link-2]                  |
# |               | R!! | Identified single, named refactoring, but executed by editing   |
# |               |     | code or without whole-project test coverage.                    |
# |               | R** | Remodeled by editing code, even in small chunks.                |
# | ------------- | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------   |
# | Documentation | d - | Developer-visible documentation not in a source file            |
# |               | d - | Developer-visible documentation in a source file changed and    |
# |               |     | verified to generate byte-identical compilation (the code       |
# |               |     | is provably unchanged).                                         |
# |               | D - | Dev-impacting only, but changes compilation or process.         |
# |               |     | E.g., changing text on a dev-only screen, or                    |
# |               |     | changes code-review checklist.                                  |
# |               | D!! | Alters an important process.                                    |
# |               | D** | Trying out a process change that is intended to gain info,      |
# |               |     | not to work.                                                    |

# Definitions
# - feature vs bug: a feature is a lot like a feature, but the intention is to change an
#   undesired - and usually unintentional - behavior of the current system.
# - remodelling / refactoring: alter the program in some way without changing any behaviour. 
# - developer documentation: changes that don't impact code or customer facing documentation
