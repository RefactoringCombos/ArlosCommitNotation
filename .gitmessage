# Arlo's Commit Notation
# https://github.com/RefactoringCombos/ArlosCommitNotation
#
# 1. Choose one of the intentions
# 2. Characterize the risk of the change
#
# == Intention ==
#
# |   | Name          | Intention                                       |
# |---|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
# | F | Feature       | Change or extend one aspect of program behavior |
# |   |               | without altering others.                        |
# | B | Bugfix        | Repair one existing, undesirable program        |
# |   |               | behavior without altering any others.           |
# | R | Refactoring   | Change implementation without changing program  |
# |   |               | behavior.                                       |
# | D | Documentation | Change something which communicates to team     |
# |   |               | members and does not impact program behavior.   |
#
# == Risk ==
# use lowercase, uppercase, and punctuation to show the change risk
#
# === Feature Risk ==
#
# |     | Known Approaches                                              |
# |-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|
# | f - | None known                                                    |
# | F - | full unit test coverage beforst starting and                  |
# |     |   change is <= 8 LoC and new code is fully unit tested        |
# | F!! | Change includes unit tests for new behavior.                  |
# | F** | No automatic tests, or unfinished implementation.             |
#
# === Bug Fix Risk ===
# A bugfix is a lot like a feature. However, the intention is to change
# an undesired — and usually unintentional — behavior of the current
# system.
#
# |     | Known Approaches                                              |
# |-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|
# | b - | None known                                                    |
# | B - | Meets all of:                                                 |
# |     | 1. reviewed original and new behaviour with customer          |
# |     |   representative                                              |
# |     | 2. change is <= 8 LoC                                         |
# |     | 3. the original (buggy) behavior was captured in a unit test  |
# |     |   prior to this change                                        |
# |     | 4. change includes 1 changed unit test, matching intended     |
# |     |   behavior alteration.                                        |
# | B!! | Change includes unit tests for new behavior.                  |
# | B** | No automatic tests, or unfinished implementation.             |
#
# === Refactoring / Remodelling Risks ===
# A Refactoring or Remodeling intends to alter the program in some way
# without changing any behavior.
#
# Provable Refactoring: https://github.com/RefactoringCombos/ArlosCommitNotation#provable-refactorings
# Procedural Refactoring: https://github.com/RefactoringCombos/ArlosCommitNotation#test-supported-procedural-refactorings
#
# |     | Known Approaches                                              |
# |-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|
# | r - | Provable refactoring                                          |
# | r - | Test-supported Procedural Refactoring within test code        |
# | R - | Test-supported Procedural Refactoring                         |
# | R!! | Identified single, named refactoring, but executed by editing |
# |     | code or without whole-project test coverage.                  |
# | R** | Remodeled by editing code, even in small chunks.              |
#
# === Developer Documentation Risks ===
# Changes that don't impact code or customer facing documentation
#
# | Code | Known Approaches                                             |
# |------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
# | d -  | Developer-visible documentation not in a source file         |
# | d -  | Developer-visible documentation verified to generate         |
# |      |   byte-identical compilation.                                |
# | D -  | Dev-impacting only, but changes compilation or process.      |
# |      |   E.g., changing text on a dev-only screen, or               |
# |      |   changes code-review checklist.                             |
# | D!!  | Alters an important process.                                 |
# | D**  | Trying out a process change that is intended to gain info,   |
# |      |   not to work.                                               |
